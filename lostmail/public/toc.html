<p><strong>Postcard 1:</strong>

<p>E-----:</p>
<p>Here are the translations you were looking for. I apologiae for my dismissive reaction to your request; engaging with outsiders feels a lost art after living too long in this place. Truly, we are all outsiders here. If you choose to visit again, I will do more to help welcome you here, despite anything you might say; I did appreciate your concern for my reputation, but what good is a reputation that cannot uplift others?</p>
<p>In peace and clarity, Marga Grimm</p>


<p><strong>Postcard 2:</strong>

<p>Dearest Friend,</p>
<p>I hope this finds you in peace and clarity. Because I don’t know when I will next see you, and I have no other way to reach you, I cannot stop writing you these letters. You can see I have tried to limit them to no more than one a day, and besides, I hear the new postal delivery is inconsistent, so perhaps the ineptitude of the bureaucracy might save you from my ramblings. I went back to that questionable establishment, the one with the big orange sign in the front, remember? It was filled with heart-rending sounds. I know you don’t think these animals can think or feel anymore, but, in this, my love, I think you to be mistaken. There is a most gentle creature here, enduring horrible conditions, and as much as I enjoy and find meaning in my itinerance, I am wrought heart-empty by my inability to provide a home for this creature. Will you permit me to imagine a safe return of both myself and my new friend, whom you have yet to meet, to your dwelling? If not soon, then, in years, or decades.</p>

<p>If you ever write to me, I will be grateful.</p>
