<p>Warmest Salutations from the esteemed council!</p>

<p>Sincerely we delight in welcoming you to the Lost Mail Redistribution Program, wherein the crowd-funded redistribution of undelivered mail will support the cessation of the expensive analog mail delivery service. This service, having been implemented as a temporary measure, has long overstayed its welcome. We appreciate your patronage in helping us to recapture the sadly-lost dignity of not having to ferry postcards through literal outer space.</p>

<p>For this special first issue, your Lost Mail Curator is <span class="bureaucrat">Edo Gomuk</span>.  They have enclosed a double-edition of two (2) postcards, specially selected because they are both  <span class="bureaucrat">examples of the once-popular fishing scene interpretations</span> and thus showcase how the <span class="bureaucrat">hostile, inhuman landscapes depicted which</span>  <span class="bureaucrat"></span> were <span class="bureaucrat">ostensibly made more palatable</span> by <span class="bureaucrat">inclusion of a stylized, idyllic human form,</span> the <span class="bureaucrat">illegibility</span> of which <span class="bureaucrat">belies</span> the  <span class="bureaucrat">illustrator’s own unfamiliarity with a softer human existence. The fishing trope was popular during the first few centuries of post-extra-terrestrial re-settlement; it is now recogniaed as representing desire to escape without a vision of how or where</span>.</p>

<p><em> (Additional curator notes)</em> <span class="bureaucrat">Remarkably, both cards share not only illustration style—which, alone, is not that strange, given its popularity even today -- but also stamp series and, crucially, the phrase “peace and clarity”. This saying is unique to one relatively obscure and remote planet -- the last settlement prior to The Reconnection Era -- which has enjoyed minimal tourism and continues to produce very few itinerants.</span>      </p>

<p>We hope you enjoy this curated selection.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
[Signature]</p>

<p>May your days be long, splendid, and many,<br>
IGPW Council </p>

<p><strong>Postcard 1:</strong>

<p>E-----:</p>
<p>Here are the translations you were looking for. I apologiae for my dismissive reaction to your request; engaging with outsiders feels a lost art after living too long in this place. Truly, we are all outsiders here. If you choose to visit again, I will do more to help welcome you here, despite anything you might say; I did appreciate your concern for my reputation, but what good is a reputation that cannot uplift others?</p>
<p>In peace and clarity, Marga Grimm</p>


<p><strong>Postcard 2:</strong>

<p>Dearest Friend,</p>
<p>I hope this finds you in peace and clarity. Because I don’t know when I will next see you, and I have no other way to reach you, I cannot stop writing you these letters. You can see I have tried to limit them to no more than one a day, and besides, I hear the new postal delivery is inconsistent, so perhaps the ineptitude of the bureaucracy might save you from my ramblings. I went back to that questionable establishment, the one with the big orange sign in the front, remember? It was filled with heart-rending sounds. I know you don’t think these animals can think or feel anymore, but, in this, my love, I think you to be mistaken. There is a most gentle creature here, enduring horrible conditions, and as much as I enjoy and find meaning in my itinerance, I am wrought heart-empty by my inability to provide a home for this creature. Will you permit me to imagine a safe return of both myself and my new friend, whom you have yet to meet, to your dwelling? If not soon, then, in years, or decades.</p>

<p>If you ever write to me, I will be grateful.</p>
