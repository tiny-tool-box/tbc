    <h1>I. Introduction</h1>
The mission (>5 years): create a model for fictional/speculative science such that:

- it creates a parallel, in the natural sciences, to what already exists in the form of thought experiments, design fictions, and other non-empirical work in humanities and social sciences
- bridges rather than divides the different disciplines (and we wou
- enables citizen science engagement not just with constrained data collection and analysis efforts, but with the critical process of reading and building on existing scientific work

Core Values:

- revel in potentially absurd levels of multi-disciplinarity
- all scientific products are free & all artist contributions are recognized and compensated
- constructive artistic collaborations can be a valid, illuminating locus of synthesis of existing scientific knowledge

The dream (>10 years):

- build on models fo apprenticeship and peer-review in a more proactively-inclusive model
- improve scientific literacy and communication of science to the public by improving the way in which "the public" could communicate back to science
- build legitimacy for the scientific work done in a peer-produced process that would involve both scientific and non-scientific contributors, i.e., by establishing an open-access journal on speculative natural science

The roadmap (next 2-3 years): reveal, part by part, the first universe within which ideas in the space of “fictional/speculative science” can be piloted, revised, experimented upon

- Focus: collaborative production of narratives and multi-media experiences - as a way to build engagement/community, and also to spark interest in engaging with the imagined Dweller universe
- Lost mail: laboratory for analog/digital material production (2018-2020)
- The Dweller Universe graphic novel - a visual narrative set in the imagined world (2018-2021)
- The Magazine: a pilot run for the future-imagined journal, but more following the pop-science magazine model for broader acceptability (2019-2021)
